This file is a python port of an identically named Matlab version.
The following comment is reproduced directly from there:
Simple script to evaluate the data fusion algorithm from the IMU and DVL.
It is a result from weekly meetings between Jessica Paterson, Keir
Groves, and Bruno Adorno

Conventions:
 - VARIABLES that would normally be written as $x^{sup}_{sub}$
in LaTeX, such as poses and rotations, are written as x_sup_sub in the
code. That is, the first string after the first underscore, sup, is the
superscript whereas the second string after the second underscore, sub,
is the subscript.

--> FOR EXAMPLE, x_1_2, which in LaTeX would be $x^1_2$ might represent
the rigid motion from the initial frame F_1 to the final frame F_2.

- VARIABLES that would normally be written as $p^{sup}_{sub1,sub2}$ in
LaTex, such as translations and twists, are written as
p_sub1_sub2_wrt_sup in the code.

--> FOR EXAMPLE, p_1_2_wrt_1, which in LaTeX would be written as
$p^1_{1,2}$ might represent the translation from the initial frame F_1 to
the final frame F_2 with respect to the frame F_1 (i.e., the coordinates
of p are expressed in frame F_1).
--> FOR EXAMPLE, twist_WORLD_IMU_wrt_WORLD might represent the twist
between the WORLD and the IMU with respect to the WORLD (that is, the
action that generates the twist is seen from the world frame).
--> FOR EXAMPLE, twist_WORLD_IMU_wrt_ANOTHERFRAME might represent the twist
between the WORLD and the IMU with respect to ANOTHERFRAME (that is, the
action that generates the twist is seen from ANOTHERFRAME, which might be
neither the world frame nor the IMU frame.


Current assumptions for this simulation:
  1) The IMU, DVL, and body frames are aligned and located at the CoM.
  2) The world frame is defined as the body frame when k=0.

Warning about notation: We are using the discrete time k. Not to confuse
with the imaginary unit k_ !
